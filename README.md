Project Name: Waste-to-Resource Exchange & Management System
Project Type: Web & Mobile App

Project Description:

Developed a comprehensive Waste-to-Resource Exchange and Management System using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) with JWT-based authentication. The platform allows users to exchange or sell waste products, with a bidding system where multiple users can place bids, and the highest bidder wins the product.

The system includes three role-based dashboards for Buyers, Donors, and Admins:

Buyers can browse items, place bids, and communicate with donors.

Donors can upload products, manage items, and interact with buyers.

Admin can manage users, items, and monitor platform activity.

Real-time communication between buyers and donors is implemented using Socket.io, while images are stored locally using Multer. The project follows secure token-based authentication, ensuring only authorized access to features.

The platform is available as both a website (React.js) and mobile app (React Native), offering a responsive, scalable, and seamless user experience.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, React Native

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)

Authentication: JWT

Real-time communication: Socket.io
